##About this blog##
This blog has been started long time ago in the purpose of keeping track of myself.
However, I haven't kept it well since 2013.  After certain age, I started to think (hard) what I want to be and how to achieve it.  I think it's the time to pick it up again and keep moving without stop.

I gain a lot from the community and hope some of the content here can also benefit you a little bit.
